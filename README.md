# tRNA_type_research
Statistical tests in order to prove the differentiation of tRNAs with type I and type II v-loops
based on the previously made model. The codes extract tRNA sequences from the Berkeley's tRNA
database, classifies them into sections of tRNA, and statistically analyzes them using
random permutation tests.
